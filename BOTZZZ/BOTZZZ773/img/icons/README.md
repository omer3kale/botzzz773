# App Icons

To complete the PWA setup, you need to add app icons to the `/img/icons/` directory.

## Required Icons:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## How to Generate Icons:

1. Create a 512x512px icon with your BOTZZZ773 logo
2. Use a tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/ to generate all sizes
3. Place the generated icons in `/img/icons/`

## Temporary Placeholder:

The icons directory already exists. You can create a simple SVG placeholder and convert it to PNG at different sizes, or use your existing logo.

The PWA will still work without icons, but they're recommended for the best user experience.
